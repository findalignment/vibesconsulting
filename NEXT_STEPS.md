# Vibes Consulting – Next Steps (Owner Playbook)

Use this as a quick checklist to get to a clean, fast launch. Keep it simple and keep momentum.

---

## 1) Wire Up Email & Forms (15–30 min)

- Contact form (Formspree)
  - Replace the placeholder endpoint in `app/(site)/contact/page.tsx`:
    - Change: `https://formspree.io/f/your-id`
    - To: your Formspree endpoint (e.g., `https://formspree.io/f/abcdwxyz`)
  - Form fields already: name, email, message
  - Test: Submit the form, verify you receive the email

- Domain email deliverability (ensures replies don’t go to spam)
  - Provider: wherever `info@vibes.consulting` is hosted
  - Add/verify DNS records for the email provider:
    - SPF (TXT): v=spf1 include:<provider> -all
    - DKIM: add the CNAME/TXT values provided by your email host
    - DMARC (TXT): `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:postmaster@vibes.consulting`
  - Send a test email from the contact form and reply back from `info@vibes.consulting`

- Optional newsletter (later)
  - Choose: ConvertKit/Mailchimp/Brevo
  - Add a simple 1-field signup if/when you have a lead magnet

---

## 2) Remove Testimonials (you don’t have any yet)

- There is no hard-coded Testimonials section right now
- Action: do not add any “Testimonials” blocks until you have 3+ strong, specific quotes
- In copy (blog, pages), keep references to testimonials as advice only (no changes needed)

---

## 3) Minimal Image Shot List (fast, authentic, mobile-first)

Add these first. Use the Image Guide for sizes and file names.

- Home
  - Hero: Santa Cruz coastal texture or calm workspace (1 wide, 1 square crop)
  - (Optional) Trust strip: light monochrome logos of partners/press

- Services (one per hub)
  - Banner for Business Flow
  - Banner for AI Integration
  - Banner for Culture Optimization

- Case Study (start with “Consulting Collective”)
  - Cover: interior/work session or relevant space
  - Inline: 1 diagram or chart showing a before/after improvement

- Blog (focused)
  - A single hub hero for “Santa Cruz Business” hub
  - One diagram for a high-traffic post (e.g., pricing, cash flow, or seasonal planning)

- Global
  - OG image (social sharing): brand + tagline layout
  - Favicon set: 32×32 `.ico`, 192/512 PNGs (optional)

Upload locations and detailed specs are in `IMAGE_GUIDE.md`.

## 4) Launch Readiness (quick wins)

- Analytics (optional now, add soon)
  - GA4 or Plausible
  - Add the snippet to `app/layout.tsx` once you create the property

- Search (Google basics)
  - Verify domain in Google Search Console
  - Submit `sitemap.xml` (generated by `app/sitemap.ts`)
  - Check `robots.txt` allows crawling (already present)

- Branding polish (30–60 min)
  - Upload hero and service banners
  - Update OG image and test at `https://www.opengraph.xyz/`
  - Set favicon set (`favicon.ico`, `icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png`)

- Accessibility basics
  - Every image: meaningful `alt` text
  - Links have clear purpose text (avoid “click here”)
  - Large tap targets (buttons are already styled)

- Performance
  - Keep each image under ~300–400 KB (most under 250 KB)
  - Reuse images across pages where possible
  - Consider enabling Next/Image later for auto-optimization

---

## 5) Known Placeholders & Where To Fill

- Contact form endpoint
  - File: `app/(site)/contact/page.tsx`
  - Replace Formspree ID, test submission

- Email addresses in policy pages (already using `info@vibes.consulting`)
  - Files: `app/(site)/privacy-policy/page.tsx`, `app/(site)/return-policy/page.tsx`
  - Confirm this is your active inbox

- Blog post dates (done)
  - Most posts have unique 2025 dates; hub pages do not need dates

- Breadcrumbs & hubs (done)
  - All SEO posts are connected to hubs; BreadcrumbList JSON-LD is embedded

---

## 6) Optional Upgrades (after launch)

- Next/Image optimization + WebP (requires minor config change)
- Simple lead magnet → email capture → nurture sequence
- Schema markup: Article schema on posts
- Replace stock imagery with original photography over time
