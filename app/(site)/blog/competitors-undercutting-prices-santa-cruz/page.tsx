            Competitor drops prices 15%. You lose customers. You match their pricing. They drop another 10%. You match again. Now neither of you is profitable. Competitor goes out of business. You're so weakened you can't recover. Everyone loses. This is price war—and it's almost always wrong strategy.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When competitor undercuts you, instinct says match them. But price competition is trap that destroys value for everyone. The businesses that survive price competition aren't the ones who fight on price—they're the ones who refuse to play that game and compete on different dimensions entirely.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Understanding competitor motivation reveals whether their pricing is sustainable threat or temporary desperation.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Reasons for Price Undercutting:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Desperation/Cash Flow Crisis</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            They're struggling, need revenue immediately, willing to lose money per sale just to generate cash. Unsustainable. Don't match desperation pricing—wait them out.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. New Entrant Buying Market Share</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            New competitor using low pricing to establish presence, funded by outside capital or willing to lose money initially. May be sustainable medium-term. Requires strategic response, not knee-jerk matching.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Lower Cost Structure</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            They genuinely have lower costs: cheaper rent, lower labor costs, different business model. Can sustain lower prices profitably. You cannot match without changing your model.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Loss Leader Strategy</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Undercutting on one product to attract customers, making profit on other items. Sophisticated strategy. Don't match loss leader pricing across everything.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Don't Understand Their Costs</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Naive pricing that doesn't account for true costs. Unsustainable but might take time for reality to hit. Don't follow them into ignorance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Different Value Proposition</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            They're budget option intentionally. You're premium option. Not actually competing for same customers. Matching their price abandons your positioning.
          </p>

    {
      title: 'When NOT to Match Prices',
      content: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Most times, matching competitor pricing is wrong move.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Don't Match When:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. You Provide Demonstrably Higher Value</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Better quality, expert service, convenient location, superior experience. Customers paying premium for premium value. Dropping price signals your value isn't real.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Matching Would Make You Unprofitable</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If their price doesn't cover your costs plus reasonable margin, matching means losing money per sale. Revenue without profit is vanity metric. Better to lose sale than lose money.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. You're Targeting Different Customer Segment</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Price-sensitive customers aren't your target. You serve quality-focused, convenience-focused, or service-focused customers. Let competitor have bargain hunters.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Competitor Likely Unsustainable</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Their pricing screams desperation or ignorance. Don't follow temporary pricing into permanent damage. Wait for them to fail or adjust.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Your Differentiation Is Non-Price</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Customers choose you for expertise, relationships, convenience, trust—not price. Matching price abandons your actual competitive advantage.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Price War Benefits Neither Business</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            In small Santa Cruz market, race to bottom destroys both businesses. Better to maintain margins and share market than destroy profitability fighting.

            Instead of matching price, change the game.

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Non-Price Competitive Responses:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Emphasize Value Differentiation</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Make premium pricing justified: "We cost 20% more because: expert staff with 10+ years experience, lifetime warranty, local sourcing, free ongoing support." Transparent about why premium exists.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Add Value Instead of Cutting Price</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Keep price same, increase value: free services, extended warranty, bundled accessories, loyalty perks. Perceived value increases without margin destruction.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Target Different Customer Segment</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Explicitly position as premium option for customers who value quality over price. "If you're looking for cheapest option, we're not it. If you want best solution, we're here."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Create Price Tiers</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Basic option at competitive price, premium option at higher price with more value. Lets price-sensitive customers buy while preserving premium for those who want it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Loyalty Program That Rewards Existing Customers</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Loyal customers get members-only pricing that beats competitor." Protects customer base without public price drop.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Service and Experience Focus</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Transform from product seller to solution provider. Consultation, custom fitting, ongoing support, community building. Relationship beats transaction on price.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">

          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Satisfaction guaranteed or full refund." Removes purchase risk that might drive customers to cheaper option. Confidence beats lowest price.

            Sometimes limited, strategic price matching is appropriate. But with rules.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Smart Price Matching Strategy:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Match on Identical Commodity Products Only</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If selling exact same brand/model as competitor, price matching removes objection. But: make money on accessories, services, and differentiated items.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Match for Existing Customers Only</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "We'll match competitor pricing for our loyal customers." Protects relationships without advertising lower price to everyone.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Match With Value-Add Included</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "We'll match their price AND include free setup/delivery/warranty." Same price, better total package.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Require Proof and Be Specific</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Show us competitor's current advertised price on identical item, we'll match." Prevents abuse, ensures you're actually competing with real pricing.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Time-Limited Matching</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "We'll match competitor pricing during their sale period only." Protects long-term margins while being competitive during temporary promotions.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Don't Advertise It Broadly</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Train staff to offer price matching when customer mentions competitor, but don't promote widely. Selective tool, not positioning strategy.

          <p className="mb-4">
            "Why we cost more: We pay living wages ($X more per item), source sustainably (adds Y%), provide expert service (trained staff cost), maintain inventory locally (no 2-week wait)." Make premium tangible.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Total Cost of Ownership</strong>

          <p className="mb-4">
            "Cheap option: $100 but lasts 1 year = $100/year. Our option: $150 but lasts 5 years = $30/year. We're actually cheaper." Reframe comparison.

            "Competitor saves you $20. If product doesn't work, you'll spend $20 in gas and time returning it, plus frustration. We guarantee it works or immediate exchange." Hidden costs of cheap.

            "Your $100 at competitor: $5 stays local, $95 goes to corporate HQ. Your $120 at us: $100 stays in Santa Cruz economy. Real difference for community." Values-based justification.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Expertise and Results</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Competitor sells product. We solve your problem correctly first time. DIY failure costs more than paying expert." Expertise justification.

            <strong>6. Customer Success Stories</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Previous customer tried competitor first, wasn't happy, came to us. Now they're loyal." Social proof that premium is worth it.

          </p>

            Become known expert in specific niche. Customers seek experts, not cheapest option. Expertise commands premium.

          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Build deep customer relationships. They buy from you because they trust you personally, not because of price. Switching costs are emotional/relational.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Create experience and community customers value beyond product. Third place, events, classes, social connection. Competing on experience, not price.
