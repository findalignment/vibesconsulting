          <p className="mb-4">
            Your employee texts at 6am: "Swell is firing, can I swap my shift?" Another requests random Thursday off because weather is perfect. Your manager wants to leave early for kid's surf lesson. Your chef needs flexible schedule for band practice. Welcome to Santa Cruz, where people explicitly chose lower wages and slower career advancement in exchange for lifestyle. If you don't accommodate lifestyle, they'll find employer who does.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This isn't laziness or unprofessionalism—it's cultural norm in community built around outdoor recreation, alternative values, and quality of life. People move to Santa Cruz and stay despite financial strain because lifestyle matters more than maximum earnings. Your business needs work done. Your employees need life balance. Finding middle ground isn't optional weakness—it's operational necessity in this market.

      title: 'What "Work-Life Balance" Means in Santa Cruz',
      content: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Definitions matter. What employees mean by "work-life balance" here is different than corporate world.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Santa Cruz Work-Life Balance Expectations:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Surf/Weather Flexibility</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When conditions are exceptional (big swell, powder at mountains, perfect weather), ability to shift schedule matters more than extra dollars. "I'll work Saturday instead of Friday if Friday is firing" is standard request.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. No Contact on Days Off</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Off" means actually off. No texts asking them to come in. No calls about work questions. No emails to respond to. Days off are sacred. Violation destroys trust immediately.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Predictable Schedules</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Want to surf mornings? Need consistent schedule to know when it's possible. Want evening band practice? Need to know which nights you work. Unpredictable schedules eliminate ability to maintain outside life.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Part-Time Option</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Many people prefer 25-30 hours over 40+ hours even though income is lower. More time for surfing, art, music, family, side projects. Full-time feels like lifestyle sacrifice.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Values Alignment</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Work should align with personal values: sustainability, community focus, local economy, authenticity. Corporate hustle culture conflicts with Santa Cruz identity.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Boundaries Respected</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Work stays at work. No expectation of evening/weekend availability unless explicitly scheduled and compensated. No guilt trips about needing time off.

      title: 'The Business Case for Flexibility',
      content: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "I need employees who prioritize work" sounds reasonable but misunderstands Santa Cruz market. Here's why flexibility isn't charity—it's competitive advantage.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Why Flexibility Helps Your Business:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Access Better Talent</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Inflexible businesses fish from shrinking pond of people desperate enough to accept poor work-life balance. Flexible businesses attract people who actively choose Santa Cruz lifestyle—often more talented, more stable, more aligned with community.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Reduce Turnover</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Employee stays 3 years with flexibility vs 8 months without. Training costs for 4 replacements &gt;&gt; costs of accommodation. Flexibility is cheaper than turnover.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Higher Productivity When Present</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Employees who got morning surf session show up energized and focused. Employees who missed perfect conditions because of rigid schedule show up resentful and distracted. Happy employees work better.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Reputation Attracts Applications</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "They're cool about surf flexibility" spreads through community. Creates recruitment pipeline. "They never let anyone take time off" also spreads. Kills recruiting.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Competitive Advantage vs Rigid Employers</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If competitors don't accommodate lifestyle, you capture all employees who value balance. Market differentiation without raising wages.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Alignment with Santa Cruz Brand</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Customers value local businesses that reflect Santa Cruz culture. Flexible workplace demonstrates authenticity. Corporate-style rigidity feels inauthentic.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Flexibility doesn't mean chaos. Structure accommodation so business needs are met while providing lifestyle balance.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Structured Flexibility Systems:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Shift Swapping Protocol</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "You can swap shifts with anyone as long as: (1) They're trained for role, (2) You arrange it yourself, (3) You notify us 24 hours ahead." Employee manages their flexibility, you maintain coverage. Everyone wins.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Consistent Core Schedule + Flex Days</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "You work Monday/Wednesday/Friday every week (predictable). Tuesday/Thursday are flex days you can swap or trade." Core coverage guaranteed, flexibility built in systematically.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Advance Request System</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Request time off 2+ weeks ahead: approved unless business can't function. Requests under 48 hours: we'll accommodate if possible, no guarantees." Clear expectations, reasonable boundaries.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Surf Call Network</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Maintain list of employees willing to cover on short notice for surf conditions. "I'll cover your shift if you cover mine next time" creates mutual support system.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. No-Questions PTO</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Don't require explanation for time off. "I need Friday off" gets approved or declined based on coverage, not justification of why. Respects autonomy.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Technology-Enabled Communication</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Use scheduling app where employees can post available shifts, request swaps, see who needs coverage. Reduces manager burden, empowers staff to solve own scheduling needs.
          </p>
        </>

      title: 'Setting Necessary Boundaries',
      content: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Flexibility has limits. Without boundaries, you enable unreliability that hurts business and other employees.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Healthy Boundaries:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Core Hours Are Non-Negotiable</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "We're open 8am-6pm daily. Someone must cover each shift. Flexibility exists within that constraint." Lifestyle accommodation doesn't mean business stops operating.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Coverage Required for Flexibility</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "You can have day off if someone covers your shift. If no one can, you work." Puts responsibility on employee to facilitate their flexibility.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Minimum Notice (Except Emergencies)</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "Surf call at 5am for 7am shift? No. 5am for 2pm shift? If you find coverage, yes." Protects opening shifts, allows flexibility for later ones.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Fairness Across Team</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            One person can't get every weekend off while others never do. Rotate desirable shifts. Track to ensure flexibility is distributed fairly.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>5. Accountability for Patterns</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Occasional flex request = fine. Every Friday off because swell = pattern abuse. "We've accommodated 8 surf days this month. We need reliability too." Address overuse.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>6. Emergency Clause</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "When we're short-staffed due to genuine emergency, everyone needs to show up. Flexibility is privilege that requires reciprocal commitment." Reserve right to call in troops when truly needed.
          </p>

      content: (
        <>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Not all employees have same expectations. Some prioritize flexibility, others prioritize income and want maximum hours. Navigate individual differences.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 mt-6">
            <strong>Handling Variation:</strong>
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-4">
            <strong>1. Define Expectations During Hiring</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "We offer surf flexibility through shift swapping but require reliability within coverage system. Does that work for you?" Pre-screen for cultural fit.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>2. Differentiate Roles</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Management requires more availability. Entry roles have more flexibility. Make trade-off explicit: "Senior role = higher pay but less flexible schedule."
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>3. Individualized Agreements</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Some employees want consistent Monday-Friday. Others want 3 longer shifts. Accommodate individual preferences within operational constraints.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4 mt-8">
            <strong>4. Acknowledge Trade-Offs</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            "You want more flexibility, which means you get fewer hours. Or more hours, which means less flexibility. Choose what matters more." Clarity prevents resentment.

          <p className="mb-4">
            "We've tried to accommodate your schedule needs, but it's creating problems for team and business. Here's what we can sustainably offer [specific parameters]. Does that work, or do we need to part ways?" Sometimes lifestyle expectations and business needs are truly incompatible. Better to acknowledge that than build resentment.
