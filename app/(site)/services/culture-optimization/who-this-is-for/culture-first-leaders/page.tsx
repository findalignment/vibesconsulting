            <p className="text-white/90 mb-3"><strong>Profile:</strong> Founder who cares deeply about team well-being. Already runs team lunches, celebrates wins, and values transparency. But felt like something was missing.</p>

            <p className="text-white/90 mb-2 mt-4"><strong>What we found:</strong></p>
            <ul className="text-white/70 text-xs space-y-1 pl-3 mb-4">
              <li>• Team loved the owner but felt unclear on expectations</li>
              <li>• Recognition was ad-hoc (some people felt overlooked)</li>
              <li>• No formal feedback loops (people didn't know how to voice concerns)</li>
              <li>• Great culture, but not designed for scale</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-white/90 mb-2 mt-4"><strong>What we built:</strong></p>
            <ul className="text-white/70 text-xs space-y-2 pl-3 mb-4">
              <li><strong>• Clarified expectations:</strong> Created role clarity docs and decision rights matrix</li>
              <li><strong>• Systemized recognition:</strong> Weekly wins ritual + monthly peer-nominated MVP</li>
              <li><strong>• Built feedback loops:</strong> Quarterly 1-on-1s + anonymous suggestion box</li>
              <li><strong>• Designed for scale:</strong> Vibe Reset framework for ongoing culture maintenance</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="text-current-500 text-xs font-medium">Result: Team engagement jumped to 9.5/10. Owner felt confident culture would stay strong as they grew.</p>
